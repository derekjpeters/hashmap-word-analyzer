# Hash Maps in JavaScript - Lesson Overview

## **Introduction**
This lesson covers the concept of **hash maps** and how to implement them in JavaScript. Hash maps (or hash tables) are data structures that store key-value pairs, providing fast access, insertion, and deletion operations.

Hash maps are crucial in programming, especially for solving problems that involve frequent searches, counting occurrences, or mapping relationships between data. This lesson provides examples of hash maps and practical interview-style problems that can be solved using hash maps.

## **Objectives**
By the end of this lesson, students will:
1. Understand the concept and importance of hash maps.
2. Learn how to implement hash maps using JavaScript's **Object** and **Map**.
3. Solve common interview problems using hash maps.
4. Integrate hash maps into larger coding projects.

## **What is a Hash Map?**
A hash map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs where each key is unique. It uses a **hash function** to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots. The key-value pair is stored at the index generated by the hash function.

### **Benefits of Hash Maps:**
- **Fast Lookup:** Hash maps provide average constant time complexity O(1) for searching, inserting, and deleting values.
- **Efficient Memory Usage:** They can store large datasets with relatively small memory overhead.

## **Hash Map Implementation in JavaScript**
In JavaScript, there are two primary ways to implement hash maps:
- Using **Objects**: Objects are native hash maps where keys are strings or symbols.
- Using the **Map** object: A more modern way to implement hash maps that allows any type of key, not limited to strings or symbols.
